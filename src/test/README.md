## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 8
- Docker >= 24
- Docker Compose >= 2.0

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup test environment
npm run test:setup
```

### Configuration Files
- Jest Configuration: `jest.config.ts`
- Playwright Configuration: `e2e/config/playwright.config.ts`
- k6 Configuration: `performance/k6.config.ts`
- Security Configuration: `security/security.config.ts`

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Set up environment variables
cp .env.test.example .env.test

# Start test containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
```

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run with coverage
npm run test:unit:coverage
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run specific suite
npm run test:integration -- --suite=api
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run in headed mode
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### Performance Tests
```bash
# Run performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Run specific scenario
npm run test:performance:load
```

### Security Tests
```bash
# Run security tests
npm run test:security

# Run vulnerability scan
npm run test:security:scan
```

## Test Utilities

### Test Data Generation
Located in `utils/test-data-generator.ts`:
- Contact data generation
- Message templates
- User profiles
- Authentication tokens

### Mocking Utilities
- API response mocks
- Service mocks
- WebSocket mocks
- File system mocks

### Test Helpers
- Authentication helpers
- Database cleanup
- Test environment setup
- Custom assertions

## Best Practices

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('Component/Feature', () => {
  beforeAll(() => {
    // Global setup
  });

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Test-specific setup
  });

  it('should behave as expected', () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Test cleanup
  });

  afterAll(() => {
    // Global cleanup
  });
});
```

### Naming Conventions
- Test files: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
- Test suites: Describe the feature/component
- Test cases: Should describe expected behavior
- Fixtures: Descriptive of data purpose

### Data Privacy
- Use anonymized test data
- Never commit sensitive information
- Use environment variables for credentials
- Clean up test data after execution

### Performance Optimization
- Use test isolation
- Implement parallel test execution
- Optimize test data setup
- Use appropriate timeouts

### Security Guidelines
- Regular dependency updates
- Secure credential management
- Compliance with security policies
- Regular security scanning

## Coverage Requirements

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- Coverage thresholds must be met
- No security vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks met

### Continuous Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run test:all
```

## Test Environments

### Local Development
```bash
# Start local test environment
npm run test:env:up

# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Stop environment
npm run test:env:down
```

### CI Environment
- Automated via GitHub Actions
- SonarQube integration
- Snyk security scanning
- k6 performance testing
- OWASP ZAP security testing

### Available Commands
```bash
npm run test:all              # Run all tests
npm run test:unit             # Run unit tests
npm run test:integration      # Run integration tests
npm run test:e2e              # Run E2E tests
npm run test:performance      # Run performance tests
npm run test:security         # Run security tests
npm run test:accessibility    # Run accessibility tests
npm run test:coverage         # Generate coverage report
```
